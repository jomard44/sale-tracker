/*
This is a math problem. I want to know a program where this problem can be solved using a program.
The inputs will be the boxes, bags and  individual flavors, and left after sales and the program will calculate the sold amount.
Question:
A store owner buys small, novelty party favours in bags of one dozen and boxes of one dozen bags (for a total of 144 favours in a box).
The store owner has 7 boxes, 2 bags, and 1 individual party favours at the start of the month. At the end of the month,
the store owner has 2 boxes, 8 bags, and 6 individual party favours left. The store owner sold how many boxes,
bags and individual flavors?

let readlineSync = require('readline-sync');

function main(){

//input
let boxes = parseInt(readlineSync.question("please enter how maney boxes you bought"));
let bags = parseInt(readlineSync.question("please enter how maney bags you bought"));
let individualFlavors = parseInt(readlineSync.question("please enter how maney flavors you bought"));

//process
